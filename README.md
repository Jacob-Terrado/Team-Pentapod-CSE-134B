This homework was quite difficult for our team. No one on our team has had previous experience with html/css, so it was incredibly hard to implement what we wanted to. This was the first time any of us had used a framework, so it took some reading and research to finally get going. 

I think our biggest problem was getting the website to be responsive. We spent a large amount of time learning how to make things responsive to mobile design, and we had to keep that in mind for every page we implemented. The wireframes provided for us showed that there was supposed to be an option to view only the numbers or the graph when viewed in mobile. We struggled to implement that functionality, so we simply just made the graph and numbers all viewable on the page when viewing on mobile.


We ran into a lot of problems with scaling. The Pure framework that we used allowed us to scale, but it was difficult getting it just right. There was a lack of proper documentation on the framework we used, so we had to spend a lot of time trying and getting things wrong before anything went right.

Placement was also a huge obstacle for us as well. We are brand new at web development, so learning the ropes for something so simple took an incredible amount of trial and error. We learned that web development is very different for us. When we want something to be placed in a certain spot, it's not as simple as specifying the margins.


We very frequently checked for validation on this homework, and ensured that we fixed any validation errors along the way, as  opposed to leaving them at the end. A lot of the validation errors taught us what was allowed and not allowed. A lot of the times our errors stemmed from styling components, and were solved by proper css syntax.

Due to our lack of experience, we spent a lot of time learning and researching for this homework. This effected our ability to really implement some of the fancy style we had in mind. However, as we progressed on the homework we started becoming more and more comfortable implementing. This homework allowed us to get our feet wet in front end development and we are excited to sharpen our skills further.
